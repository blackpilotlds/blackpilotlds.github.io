<!-- Your JavaScript looks great! It works perfectly and is easy to follow. Nice
job. I do have some recommendations on the responsive parts of your page. When
adjusting the page size, the number of columns switches before they can actually
be seen. For example, you go to 2 columns of 385px each at 668px.
385px+385px=770px. Instead of specifying the width of the columns in pixels, you
could do 1fr(for small view) 1fr, 1fr (for medium view), 1fr, 1fr, 1fr, 1fr (for
large view). That will make it use just the space that is available.
Additionally, instead of making your images have a max-width of 300px, maybe
give them a percentage, such as 75%. This also allows them to adjust as the
container changes size.  -->
