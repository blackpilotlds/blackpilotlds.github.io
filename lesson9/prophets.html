<!--  Brienna Sambrano: [2020-06-16] Your JavaScript looks great! It works
perfectly and is easy to follow. Nice job. I do have some recommendations on the
responsive parts of your page. When adjusting the page size, the number of
columns switches before they can actually be seen. For example, you go to 2
columns of 385px each at 668px. 385px+385px=770px. Instead of specifying the
width of the columns in pixels, you could do 1fr(for small view) 1fr, 1fr (for
medium view), 1fr, 1fr, 1fr, 1fr (for large view). That will make it use just
the space that is available. Additionally, instead of making your images have a
max-width of 300px, maybe give them a percentage, such as 75%. This also allows
them to adjust as the container changes size.  -->
