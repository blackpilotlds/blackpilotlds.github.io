            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>The Maya are believed to have first settled Cozumel by the early
            part of the 1st millennium AD, and older Preclassic Olmec artifacts
            have been found on the island as well. The island was sacred to Ix
            Chel, the Maya Moon Goddess, and the temples here were a place of
            pilgrimage, especially by women desiring fertility. There are a
            number of ruins on the island, most from the Post-Classic period.
            The largest Maya ruins on the island were near the downtown area and
            have now been destroyed. Today, the largest remaining ruins are
            at San Gervasio, located approximately at the center of the island.
            </p>
            <p>The first Spanish expedition to visit Cozumel was led by Juan de
            Grijalva in 1518. In the following year Hernán Cortés stopped
            by the island on his way to Veracruz. The Grijalva and Cortés
            expeditions were both received peacefully by the Maya of Cozumel,
            unlike the expeditions’ experiences on other parts of the mainland.
            Even after Cortés destroyed some of the Maya idols on Cozumel and
            replaced them with an image of the Virgin Mary, the native
            inhabitants of the island continued to help the Spanish re-supply
            their ships with food and water so they could continue their
            voyages. Gerónimo de Aguilar was rescued at this time.
            </p>
            <p>As many as 10,000 Maya lived on the island then, but in 1520,
            infected crew members of the Pánfilo Narváez expedition brought
            the smallpox contagion to the island and by 1570 only 186 men
            and 172 women were left alive on Cozumel. In the ensuing years
            Cozumel was often the target of attacks by pirates, and in 1650
            many of the islanders were forcibly relocated to the mainland
            town of Xcan Boloná to avoid the Buccaneers’ predation. Later,
            in 1688, most of the rest of the island's population, as well as
            many of the settlements along the Quintana Roo coast, were
            evacuated inland to towns such as Chemax. ...
