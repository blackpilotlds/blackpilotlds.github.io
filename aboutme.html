                My kids like to play Roblox. I tried to play with them, but didn't like it  to be honest. 
                My wife changed her major from Business Management to Applied Technology, and now we both study the same thing.

        <h1>Mission Service</h1>
            <p>
                I served my mission in Russia, 2008-2010. Before that, I went to 
                MTC Provo to get my endowment, patriarchal blessing, and some 
                training (4 weeks long). I was called to Russia St. Petersburg Mission, 
                and at the same time my future wife was called to Russia Vladivostok mission. 
                We were in the same MTC class, she is Russian.
